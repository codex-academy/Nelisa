# Search and filter

> Nelisa needs to find sales data statistics quickly.

Create a search bar:

* that works without using any client-side JavaScript;
* that uses JavaScript to display the search results after the user has typed three or more characters into the search box;

Add search bars to your Categories, Products, Sales and Purchases list screens.

Add support for:

* finding products by category name;
* finding sales by product or category name;
* finding purchases by product or category name.
