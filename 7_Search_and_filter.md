# Search and filter

> Nelisa needs to find sales data statistics quickly.

Create search bar/s:

* that always works, even if Javascript is disabled in the browser  ;
* that display the search results automatically after the user have typed three or more characters in the search box;

Add search bar/s to your Categories, Products, Sales and Purchases list screens.

Add support for:

* Finding products by category name;
* finding sales by product or category name;
* finding purchases by product or category name.

# Learning areas

* Queries using partial string matching - using `like` sql queries;
* using HTTP [request parameters](http://expressjs.projectcodex.co/steps/routes.html/#routes-with-parameters) using `req.params`;
* introduction to Ajax for a dynamic search experience;
* introduction to [Progressive Enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/) - the journey from a simple search to interactive search.
