# Search and filter

> Nelisa needs to find sales data statistics quickly.

Create a search bar for your Products page. Once that's working, look at using client-side JavaScript to display the search results after the user has typed three or more characters into the search box.

Read more about searching and Ajax at [search.projectcodex.co](http://search.projectcodex.co/).

## Search more things

Add search bars to your Categories, Sales, and Purchases pages.

Add support for:

* finding products by category name;
* finding sales by product or category name;
* finding purchases by product or category name.

# Testing

Make sure you write your code TDD-style.

# Learning areas

* using HTTP [request parameters](http://expressjs.projectcodex.co/steps/routes.html#routes-with-parameters) using `req.params`;
