# Web application basics

<!--codex ignore purchase-->
> Nelisa needs data to be managed online with Sales and Purchase data captured online.

* Add support to Create, Update, and Delete records for Products, Categories, Sales and Purchases in the database.
* Add DalekJS tests for your CRUD functionality. You can use [`crud.js`](http://nelisa.projectcodex.co/dalekjs/crud.js) as a base.

# Learning areas

* using HTML forms;
* storing data submitted via an HTML form in the database;
* learning about `request` and `response` HTTP objects.

# Modules to install

* [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): making `req.body` work.
