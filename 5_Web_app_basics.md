# Web application basics

<!--codex ignore purchase-->
> Nelisa needs data to be managed online with Sales and Purchase data captured online.

Add support to Add, Delete and Update records for Products, Categories, Sales and Purchases in the database.

# Modules to install

* [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): making `req.body` work.

# Testing

Don't forget to write your code TDD-style and use the test user, password, and database.

Have another look at the [User Experience](http://fefg.projectcodex.co/user-experience.html) of your web app. Use the principles there to review your app. Add a `ux-review.md` to your repo with the results of your review.

# Learning areas

* using HTML forms;
* storing data submitted via an HTML form in the database;
* learning about `request` and `response` HTTP objects.
