# Deployment, roles and login

> Nelisa needs to see her sales data deployed and it should only accessible by a selection of users. And only Xolani should be able to add Categories, Products and Purchases and Sales data.

# Learning areas:

* custom middleware - to check roles and if a user is logged in
* [Http Session](#) to store logged in username & role
* [bcrypt](#) to encrypt user passwords
